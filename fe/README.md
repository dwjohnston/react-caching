## Instructions

Two terminals. Start backend with `yarn start`. Start frontend with `yarn start`. 

Click between Page A and Page B and note that it needs to load the users each time. 

Stop the backend, and start with `yarn start:caching`. 

Now note that the load is not longer required when you click between.
